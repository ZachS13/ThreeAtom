# ThreeAtom

A simple starter project using **Three.js** to create interactive 3D graphics in the browser.

## What is Three.js?

[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) is a JavaScript library built on top of WebGL that simplifies the process of creating 3D animations and visualizations in the browser. It abstracts the complex parts of WebGL, making it easier and more accessible for developers.

## Use Cases for Three.js

Three.js is incredibly versatile. You can use it to:

- Render interactive 3D models in the browser
- Build animated environments or maps for games
- Prototype 3D game engines
- Visualize data or scientific models in 3D

## How to Start a Three.js Project

1. Create the basic files (`index.html`, `main.js`) â€” already included in this repo
2. Install Three.js:  
   ```
   npm install three
   ```
3. In your JavaScript file, import the library:  
   ```js
   import * as THREE from 'three';
   ```
4. Set up the **Camera**, **Scene**, and **Renderer**
5. Add the renderer to the DOM
6. Create your 3D objects
7. Animate and render them inside a loop
